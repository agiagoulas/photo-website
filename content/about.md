Hi, I'm Alex and this is my page about photography.

![image of alex](/alex.jpg)

I’ve been into photography for over ten years now. I mostly shoot urban architecture, street scenes, and landscapes. My go-to setup is my Leica M11 with a 35mm or 50mm lens, but every now and then I also shoot a couple rolls of film with my Leica M4-2.
